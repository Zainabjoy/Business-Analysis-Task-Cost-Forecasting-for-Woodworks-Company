## ðŸ“˜ Business Analysis Task â€“ Cost Forecasting for Woodworks Company

As part of my **Business Analysis course on Coursera**, I completed a practical task involving cost forecasting for a custom furniture manufacturer â€” **The Woodworks Company**.

### Task Summary:

The company produces custom-designed wooden furniture using either **cherry** or **oak**. I analyzed a scenario where both **wood prices** and **labor costs** are expected to increase annually. The task involved:

* Calculating current costs of production (board-feet of wood and labor hours)
* Projecting **future costs** based on anticipated yearly increases
* Identifying cost drivers that affect profitability
* Interpreting the business impact of material and labor inflation

###  Tools/Concepts Used:

* Spreadsheet modeling (Excel)
* Cost analysis
* Forecasting techniques
* Business decision support
